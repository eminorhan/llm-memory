Which of these distributions happens depends on competition; if there’s no competition, the company will be able to take the whole surplus; if there’s a lot of competition, all the companies will compete to lower prices until they’ve handed most of the surplus to the customers.

So in this sense, maybe Bezos’ extra portion of the surplus is in some sense coming from ordinary people. This would be surprising, because Amazon already has very low prices.

When someone improvises too much, that is, they are creating the rules as they go along or, worse still, decide that there are no rules, then it is not improvisation but delirium. Improvisation is establishing which rules I am going to follow and then, without taking time to plan, coordinate or strategize, all of the sudden, I do something artistic: writing, painting, music, etc. If I decide to play the piano and just bash a random key, that's not improvisation. That's, well, nothing. And what amazes the public about the improviser is how they create difficulties for themselves and then overcome them.

If you don’t speak Spanish, you may know that’s wrong even though you don’t speak Spanish just by virtue of having watched a buch of American movies where they show a dumb American saying stuff like that to show he’s a dumb American. There are many paths to knowledge, that’s what I’m trying to say, and as Jackie Chan knows very well, intuition has to be trained.

He takes his method from Kandinsky and the method is “Never go Full Unconscious”. For Kandinsky, improvisation is a way through which an artist reaches a higher form, which is composition. You use your improvisation as material for your final work. That’s why only 81 entries survive in Kora In Hell from the original 365. Williams cut all the nonsense out so you don’t have to suffer it like Frida suffered the surrealist’s air poisoning.

White is birth, black is death, green is nature, yellow is happiness, blue is peace and so on. Literary critics will sometimes talk about a text by mapping such correspondences, because the craft is descended from the hermeneutics of Holy Books, where correct interpretation could turn out to be the key to salvation or enlightenment or knowledge of divine will, and this often scares people away from reading primary sources. For example, every chapter in James Joyce’s Ulysses references an event in the Odyssey, sure, but how the hell are you supposed to figure out on your own that each one is dominated by a particular color and a particular part of the body and so on if an expert doesn’t tell you that. Well, it turns out it’s not that important. It’s just something Joyce did to encourage himself to continue writing his Holy Book dedicated to the God of Art. You can extract meaning from his fried inner organs of beasts and fowls, but that’s because you can extract meaning from anywhere.

Williams is usually thought of as a visual poet, in the sense that he uses a lot of visual metaphors and really really likes to talk about painting, paintings and painters like Kandinsky. But as he jumps from metaphor to metaphor I personally found the best way to understand what he is saying is to follow logically the way words unravel themselves in space. That is a visual metaphor for, in Marshall McLuhan’s terms, a rational, continuous and uniform way of reading a text which is in itself not rational, but discontinuous and fragmentary. “Many matters are touched but not held by the speed of emotions thrashing, more often broken by the contact, and by the brokenness of his composition the poet makes himself master of a certain weapon which he could possess himself of in no other way”. Like Cortazar's Hopscotch, Kora in Hell lets you alter the order in which you read it. Williams: “There’s more sense in a sentence heard backwards than forwards most times.” If you prefer, again in McLuhan's terms, the participatory, incomplete, mosaic images, you should definitely start with the improvisations, and maybe even skip the commentary altogether. Ezra Pound said “It is not necessary to read everything in a book in order to speak intelligently of it. Don’t tell everybody I said so.” But if you like rationality, and if you’re reading this you probably do, then you can start with the commentary and use it as a frame of reference.

You would go crazy if you tried to devote 100% of your time and money to helping others. But if you decide to just help when you feel like it or a situation comes up, you’ll probably forget. Is there some more systematic way to commit yourself to some amount between 0% and 100% of your effort (traditionally 10%)?

I think he would make an argument something like Gregory Lewis’ Most Small Probabilities Aren’t Pascalian. This isn’t about an 0.000001% chance of affecting 50 quadrillion people.

Sometimes growth builds on itself; when there is a lot of growth, people are in a good mood and stakeholders are willing to make sacrifices for the future, trusting that there’s much more where that came from. When growth slows, everyone becomes fiercely protective of what they have, and play zero-sum games with each other in ways not conducive to future growth. So one potential catastrophe is a vicious cycle of stagnation that slows growth for millennia. Since our current tech level is pretty conducive to world destruction (we have nukes and the ability to genetically engineer bioweapons, but nothing that can really defend against nukes or genetically-engineered bioweapons), staying at the current tech level for millennia is buying a lot of lottery tickets for world destruction.

When slavery was abolished, the shlef price of sugar increased by about 50 percent, costing the British public £21 million over seven years - about 5% of British expenditure at the time. Indeed, the slave trade was booming rather than declining: even though Britain had abolished its slave trade between 1807, more Africans were taken in the transatlantic slave trade between 1821 and 1830 than any other decade except the 1780s. The British government paid off British slave owners in order to pass the 1833 Slavery Abolition Act, which gradually freed the enslaved across most of the British Empire. This cost the British government £20 million, amounting to 40% of the Treasury’s annual expenditure at the time.

Britain had some economic incentive here to prevent their rivals from selling slave-produced goods at lower prices than they could. But the scale of their activism doesn’t seem worth it: from 1807 to 1867, enforcing abolition cost Britain almost 2% of its annual national income, several times what Britain spends today on foreign aid; political scientists Robert Pape and Chaim Kaufmann described this campaign as “the most expensive international moral effort in modern history”.", "par_id": 326, "url_id": 8}

But this happened in 2015, and the relationship between PredictIt and Aristotle hasn’t changed since then. Also, supposedly PredictIt has been “in regular communication” with the CFTC throughout its lifespan to make sure they were on the right side of the law; if CFTC was angry about something they did in 2015, why wouldn’t they have told them before now?

While interesting, and giving her a chance to shoehorn in some examples of what I presume was part of her previous book on sexology and perversion in the 19th century (which I haven’t read, but now kind of want to), it doesn’t really add much to the overall picture we are concerned with here.", "par_id": 867, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Besides, around this period however the major concern was more earthly; sins such as masturbation (Aquinas famously ranked this quite highly amongst the sexual sins) had now become terrifying causes of mental and physical turmoil in tracts such as Onania: or, the heinous sin of self-pollution and all its frightful consequences (in both sexes) considered with spiritual and physical advice to those who have already injured themselves by this abominable practice  (1756). People began to attribute a number of symptoms of exhaustion to the practice, which was felt to be exploding in popularity (sorry) due to the excess of leisure time and the availability of printed smut. Tissot, the author of a later screed on masturbation, enumerates a number of frightening outcomes:", "par_id": 868, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "… loss of life energy, weakness and exhaustion, but also convulsions, sleeplessness, paleness, pimples, consumption, diarrhoea, the weakening of intellectual powers, bad digestion, vomiting, anguish, paralysis, spasms, melancholy, catalepsy, epilepsy, imbecility, loss of sensation, disorders of the urinary system and even death.", "par_id": 869, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "This is particularly pronounced in men, for whom the loss of seminal fluid is allegedly forty times more damaging to vital energy than losing an equivalent amount of blood. Semen-accounting practices aside, the main point is that here we begin to find the tying together of Galen’s humoral imbalances with the idea of a loss of vital energy that cannot be easily replaced. In Schaffner’s account, as technology moved on into the industrial era, we start to see new ideas from science being put into service to explain exhaustion, and many of these theories concerned the expenditure or transfer of finite amounts of energy and a subsequent rest state or energy deficit: that is, we begin to use things up and can’t replenish them. These ideas included the thermodynamic idea of entropy, discoveries in the electrical nature of nerve conduction, and the ideas of genetic and mental degeneration.", "par_id": 870, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "This led to the development in the 19th century of a new, vaguely defined illness known as neurasthenia. It was, in the conception of the time, an illness of overworked and played out nerves due to their overstimulation at the hands of industrialisation and modern society. A neat rhetorical trick was employed by physicians at the time, who claimed that sensitive and creative people doing brain work were more susceptible than those in the working classes. This is an important change, as it begins the move away from the moralistic conception of exhaustion and produces a blame-free, stigma-free conception of an illness which has a tendency to strike the special and the smart. It is no coincidence that many of the writers and thinkers I mentioned earlier that suffered from exhaustion (James, Woolf, Mann, Wilde et al) are all concentrated in this era – they all were diagnosed with neurasthenia. As Darwin announces and elaborates on the theory of evolution, more attention is paid to the idea of inherited weaknesses in nerves, culminating in cultural accounts like Huysmans’s Á rebours (Against Nature), which described the final, exhausted, idle throes of generations of inbreeding in the person of a decadent, hypersensitive and exhausted noble recluse.", "par_id": 871, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "If you’re a doctor in this period, the other benefit of the reformulation of exhaustion into neurasthenia is that it manifests in those who are rich enough to pay your fee, and simultaneously makes the physician indispensable. So, we begin to see in the writings of physicians, psychiatrists and novelists the two opposing views of how this condition is to be best treated. On one side, we have rest; the other, activity.", "par_id": 872, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Improvised rest cures were followed by Darwin (who could only intermittently attend to work on the Beagle and had regular daily periods of repose at home throughout his life, interspersed with hydrotherapy at various spas), with more prescriptive programmes followed by Virginia Woolf, who followed a ‘rest cure’ for women designed by an American physician named Silas Mitchell. The rest cure was premised on unambiguous misogyny: the idea that women were overstimulated by moving outside the home and doing things that they were unsuited for, like thinking and writing, were wearing out their nerves and depleting their blood of nutrients. Thus, the home (and bed)-bound, low-stimulus, rest cure, that also focused on rapid weight gain (“to gain in fat is nearly always to gain in blood”).", "par_id": 873, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "On the other hand, we have the exhortation to activity, which as we’ve seen has been a suggestion from at least the days of monks with acedia, but is now in the West explicitly linked with the co-called Protestant work ethic, with work and its resultant energy and meaning being thought of as a necessary good (Max Weber, the sociologist who coined the term, was also diagnosed with neurasthenia – it seems a wonder anything intellectual got done during this period). There’s a gender bias here; while women had the rest cure, men diagnosed in the late 19th Century might be prescribed a “West Cure” where they might, in Mitchell’s words, “engage in a sturdy contest with Nature” by spending time with cowboys and sleeping rough – something Billy Crystal also found helpful.", "par_id": 874, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "The twentieth century was an era of rapid advances in Western medicine, particularly in virology and immunology. New vaccinations for illnesses were developed, antibiotics and antivirals became available, surgical techniques and safety advanced, the fatal childhood illness of diabetes was turned into a chronic adult illness by insulin, cancers were cured, and medicine discovered the randomised control trial and began lambasting all other health disciplines for not upholding the fine traditions of evidence-based medicine that they had only just invented.", "par_id": 875, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "At the same time, there was an increasing recognition of, and alarm about, the environmental effects of industrialisation – toxic chemicals, greenhouse gases, nuclear and other electromagnetic radiation, noise, antibiotics and hormones in our food, genetic modification of crops, and many others.", "par_id": 876, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "So it is not surprising that, just as contemporary theology, culture or science has been harnessed into previous explanations of exhaustion and its related symptoms, new explanations have been developed that lean on the anxieties of our times. The major differences in the more modern conception of exhaustion is the way affected individuals seek out biomedical explanations, but do so in the face of a medical establishment that looks at these explanations as incomplete or wrong.", "par_id": 877, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Schaffner gives a reasonable accounting of the way CFS was characterised – post-polio fatigue being noticed in the 1950s, the discovery of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) in the 1960s and the initial thoughts that EBV was a robust cause of CFS, the subsequent discovery that about 95% of the population has had EBV so this explanation couldn’t be complete, followed by classification of the syndrome settling into a cause-agnostic set of symptoms. This, however, didn’t stop the fighting.", "par_id": 878, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Essentially the conflict lines up between three rough groups. The first is the patient advocacy groups, who are made up of a group of sufferers of the condition and (some of) of their carers and family, who firmly believe that there is an undiscovered viral or autoimmune condition that not only caused their condition but continued to exert its effects in their ongoing symptoms. It’s not simply that they had an infection and are now deconditioned or slow to recover; it’s that the condition was never properly diagnosed, is continuing to account for their ongoing exhaustion, and could people please stop referring them to psychiatrists. This group is heterogeneous but on the whole prefers names for the condition that imply an ongoing disease process, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis.", "par_id": 879, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Opposite them are a mix of (some of) the sufferer’s frustrated partners, carers and family members who have difficulty with living with someone who has chronic disability. This can include the individual’s doctor, who sometimes deals with chronicity poorly. The fringes of this group start muttering darkly about mass psychogenic illnesses and fads, access to insurance and compensation, and prefer to use the term chronic fatigue syndrome but with audible air quotes. You may think this is strawmanning the anti-CFS group, but Schaffner has the medical/psychiatric historian Edward Shorter to set us straight:", "par_id": 880, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "The Saga of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a kind of cautionary tale for those doctors who lose sight of the scientific underpinning of medicine, and for those patients who lose their good sense in the media-spawned ‘disease of the month’ clamor that poisons the doctor-patient relationship… A whole subculture of chronic fatigue has arisen in which those patients too tired to walk give each other hints about how to handle a wheelchair and exchange notes about how to secure disability payments from the Government or from their insurance companies.", "par_id": 881, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "The medical consensus about CFS is different from both of these extremes, with the current conception being that there are a number of different pathways into the condition. Some of them are likely triggered by the immunological response to viral infections, with COVID being the most recent example of one of these (hence ‘Long COVID’). But, because not everyone who gets COVID/EBV/whatever develops this syndrome, something else needs to be going on. That something, in the case of COVID, could be a particular immunological profile leading to some ongoing inflammatory response, but this hasn’t been established for other viruses. Not to mention that when people actually try to characterise whatever this immunological response might be, the state of the evidence appears to be ‘cytokines, natural killer cells, T-calls something something’. ", "par_id": 882, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "And those who get CFS also often have many of the same risk factors we find predisposing to mental illness – childhood trauma, or pre-existing anxiety or depression. This might make people vulnerable to developing some maladaptive thoughts about their convalescence that can in turn lead to longer-lasting deficits. CFS researcher Simon Wesseley:", "par_id": 883, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "We suggest that agents such as EBV or viral meningitis can lead to the experience of abnormal symptoms, such as fatigue, malaise and myalgia. However, the transition from symptoms to disability may be more closely linked to cognitive and behavioural factors. Hence interventions such as CBT designed to reduce disability and counteract maladaptive coping strategies ought to be more effective in reducing disability than symptoms. The evidence so far supports this model – many patients do show considerable improvements in disability and everyday functioning, but are not rendered symptom-free by cognitive or behavioural interventions.", "par_id": 884, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Wesseley is right about the evidence: there is some evidence for CBT and graded exercise, with Wesseley himself providing one study into the latter – a study that led to him getting death threats from patient groups.", "par_id": 885, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Why the death threats? The sense of intense anger and distress at the mere whiff of a non-biological component of the explanation, or a non-biological treatment, is due in part to the long process people go through to get to a diagnosis. CFS is a condition that assumes the trappings of biomedical Western medicine, but suffers from the inconvenient lack of concrete blood and X-ray results that would convince biomedically-minded doctors to take it seriously. Sufferers describe going from doctor to doctor, receiving greater or lesser doses of Shorter-style hostility or incomprehension, sometimes only coming across the diagnosis online. Having been told, explicitly or implicitly, that “it’s all in your head”, the natural response is to kick as hard as possible in the other direction.", "par_id": 886, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Psychiatrists are adept at answering the question “Is it real, or is it all in my head?” with “Yes”. Unfortunately, much of our folk psychology is more Cartesian than this, and the idea that only biomedical symptoms are real is well entrenched with a large chunk of the population, including many doctors. And, as Schaffner points out, if you’re not fighting your attitudes towards disease and your depression, you’re fighting modernity and an unchangeable immune system, and in that fight you’re always going to feel overmatched.", "par_id": 887, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "One of Schaffer’s main points is that, despite the shift in narratives about how we explain exhaustion to ourselves, each age has the tendency to link it both to sociocultural critiques of current society (as compared to a mythologised more natural, simpler age) and to utilise the latest explanatory models current in culture or science at the time. Thus, in medieval times we get acedia, the sign of a more sinful and corrupt decline in Christian practice; from the late Baroque period and on into the Victorian era there are a lot of discussions about sexual practices being the culprit in this new age of licentiousness; in the late 19th century we find neurasthenia due to the idea of nervous energy being prematurely used up by a combination of the demands of an industrialised world and the degeneration of dissolute bloodlines; or more recently a mystery virus, modern toxin or immunological disorder that relies on the edifice of scientific medicine to diagnose, an edifice that is populated by a group of clinicians and researchers who are largely sceptical of (or even hostile to) this explanation.", "par_id": 888, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "But what is chronic fatigue syndrome really? Schaffner’s view is that it’s the newest explanation for an age-old set of linked experiences that people have suffered and written about for thousands of years. I agree with this as far as it goes, but this doesn’t mean that current conceptions of the condition are equivalent to those seen in the past – our advancing knowledge of the immunology, virology and the links between mind and body should count for something, otherwise we are just telling new stories about illness that are objectively worse because they don’t even have any sexy vampires.", "par_id": 889, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "But it is clear that people make different meanings of their suffering, and focus on different things when they report it. Classical melancholic depression, for instance, also features lack of energy, appetite and sensory changes alongside the low mood and feelings of guilt and suicidality. Are we simply seeing an artificial divide between people with prominent fatigue who receive or cling to a biological explanation (CFS sufferers) vs people who receive or cling to a psychological explanation (depression sufferers)? Shorter would have us think so, and has thrown in some accusations of malingering in the CFS group for good measure. But most psychiatrists would still class melancholia and CFS as two different conditions. And to complicate things further there is likely to be overlap, as chronic disability makes you depressed, and severe depression leads to you becoming physically deconditioned.", "par_id": 890, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "There is some hint, though, that CFS is something that is a subset of a wider group of other contested disorders, separated only by the explanation that sufferers prefer. When people have similar sets of non-specific symptoms, and they attribute them to electromagnetic sensitivity, Chronic Lyme Disease occurring in countries with and without Borrelia-carrying ticks (but also, sexism), household chemicals, or Communist death rays, then you have to conclude that there is a lot we don’t know about human energy and its lack.", "par_id": 891, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Would I recommend this book? Yes - it covers a lot of ground, including several aspects I’ve barely touched on here as I raced towards a discussion of modern CFS. Schaffner riffs on some other culprits including Saturn and other astrological bodies, exhaustion as a critique of capitalism in literary works, and includes a discussion of modern workplace burnout (which is what the ‘special and smart person’ humblebrag elements of neurasthenia appear to have evolved into). The book isn’t perfect – some of her literary examples seem a bit stretched (there’s an extended discussion of Jason and the Argonauts which conflates despair and exhaustion, as well as an off-base interpretation of Lars Von Trier’s film Melancholia), there’s a chapter-long engagement with Freud’s idea of the death drive that seems to only tangentially touch on exhaustion, and she relies on some oversimplified psychiatric models of depression (not as simple as serotonin deficiency).", "par_id": 892, "url_id": 17}
{"par": "Her conclusion manages to weave in Pope Francis, because apparently when you start a book with a Pope you need to finish with one, but also touches on the idea of exhaustion of natural resources, climate change and the vagaries of capitalism to create an idea that maybe, after a succession of periods in which everyone thought their age was the most draining, perhaps we are indeed the ones with the best reasons to be exhausted.", "par_id": 893, "url_id": 17}

For about the first year of the pandemic, it was widely accepted that SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, had a natural origin, meaning that it first spread to humans naturally from an animal (also called a zoonotic origin). Any suggestion that it could have come from a lab was dismissed as a conspiracy theory. Then, sometime around spring 2021 something changed. Well-known, respected scientists began to voice the opinion that SARS-CoV-2 might have come from a lab, or that it’s at least a plausible hypothesis that deserves an investigation.

It’s not convincing at all to hear “SARS-CoV-2 definitely had a natural origin, and anything else is just a conspiracy theory”. On the other hand, when you’re trying to weigh two legitimate, competing hypotheses, it becomes necessary to seriously consider the evidence for each one, and Chan and Ridley spend much of the book considering the evidence of natural origins.", "par_id": 1016, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The main case for the natural origins hypothesis is that it should be our default belief, in the absence of convincing evidence otherwise. The vast majority of disease outbreaks like this, including previous coronavirus outbreaks SARS (2003) and MERS (2012), came from nature, not from a lab. So, before examining the evidence, we should begin with a strong prior in favor of natural origins.", "par_id": 1017, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Also, the Chinese government and scientists deny lab origins of the virus. In the context of an authoritarian system this may count for very little, but it’s still some nonzero evidence in favor of natural origins. To say there was a lab origin, we would have to postulate that scientific institutions in China are lying and successfully engaged in a coverup, for which there have been no credible whistleblowers. Again, this may be entirely possible, but it still adds to the burden of proof that must be overcome by evidence for the lab leak hypothesis.", "par_id": 1018, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "However, what’s still missing is any direct evidence for an animal source of SARS-CoV-2. Chan and Ridley note that during the SARS (2003) and MERS (2012) coronavirus outbreaks, the animal sources were discovered relatively quickly. But with COVID-19, now more than 2 years into the pandemic, an animal source still has not been identified, despite the fact that we now have access to better investigative tools, like faster and cheaper genome sequencing compared to the SARS and MERS investigations.", "par_id": 1019, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The authors steel-man one possible explanation for this lack of direct evidence that would be consistent with a zoonotic origin: illegal smuggling. They explain that if the animal source had been an illegally smuggled animal, the smugglers may have engaged in a coverup and tried to hide their tracks. Chan and Ridley spend a section of the book describing the illegal wildlife trade in China – a reminder that even if the pandemic had what we’re calling a “natural origin,” it was likely still a self-inflicted wound for humanity, and policy changes may still be needed to prevent it from happening again.", "par_id": 1020, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "As a non-fiction book on current events, an unavoidable weakness of Viral is that it does not include recent developments that have come out after the book’s publication. At least one of these developments is important enough for me to mention in this review. In February 2022, three scientific pre-prints [1, 2, 3] were released, related to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Huanan seafood market in the early stage of the pandemic. The Huanan seafood market, located in Wuhan, is thought by natural origins proponents to have been the source of the first zoonotic spillover (or possibly, two separate spillovers) into humans. Advocates of this hypothesis have taken these pre-prints as further confirmation of a zoonotic origin in the market. However, proponents of the lab leak hypothesis have pointed out that they never denied that an early superspreader event occurred in the market – they just think the virus was brought there by an infected human, and spread to others in the crowded and enclosed space. They point to the fact that all of the market animals that were tested for COVID came up negative. Fence-sitters, like Chan, say that the pre-print findings appear to be consistent with both hypotheses.", "par_id": 1021, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "There are also technical points and counterpoints about these studies being debated. For example, one of the studies attempts to use geospatial analysis to show that locations of early COVID cases seems to cluster around the market. A possible rebuttal to this point is that it might be based on ascertainment bias – at the start of the pandemic, authorities suspected the market as a source of the outbreak and specifically looked for patients who’d recently been at the market, so it’s not surprising to see early cases cluster around the market if market exposure was part of the criteria for being diagnosed with COVID. ", "par_id": 1022, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "A lot of these technical points are over my head, so I encourage you to read the pre-prints (as well as the critiques of them) yourself. Here are some more sources to check out about these recent pre-prints and the debate around them [1, 2, 3].", "par_id": 1023, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "When I first heard the idea of a lab origin of SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of the pandemic, part of the reason I dismissed it was because the idea of a pathogen escaping from a lab really did seem like a conspiracy theory, or the plot of some sci-fi movie. One of the things that made me reconsider this position was learning how many lab leaks have occurred in the past. Chan and Ridley spend a chapter in the book reviewing some of these incidents. For example:", "par_id": 1024, "url_id": 21}

{"par": "In April 1979, anthrax escaped from a biological warfare lab in Sverdlovsk, USSR, resulting in at least 64 deaths. This leak was successfully covered up by the Soviet authorities for more than a decade, with the KGB confiscating hospital records of the victims. The truth was only discovered after the fall of the Soviet Union, when a proper scientific investigation was finally allowed in 1992 and 1993.", "par_id": 1026, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "In 1977 there was an influenza pandemic, now called the Russian Flu, which ultimately killed about 700,000 people. It was discovered that this flu strain was nearly genetically identical to a strain that had previously been common in the 1950s, but had since disappeared, except for samples that were being studied in research labs. It’s now thought that the 1977 Russian Flu was the result of vaccine trials gone awry, in which military recruits became infected after being exposed to live attenuated H1N1 virus.", "par_id": 1027, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Smallpox escaped from research labs in the UK three times from 1966-1978. In fact, the last ever case of smallpox occurred after it had already been eradicated, when it escaped from a medical laboratory in 1978 and infected a medical photographer, who eventually died from the illness.", "par_id": 1028, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "These are only a few of many examples. According to the US Federal Select Agent Program, which oversees the possession and handling of dangerous biological agents and toxins, there were 219 accidental releases of these “select agents” in 2019. So, while accidental lab leaks are uncommon, they’re not unheard of. When it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic, it still makes sense to have a strong prior in favor of the natural origins hypothesis, but the idea that a pathogen can be accidentally released from a lab isn’t some wild, ridiculous idea like believing in alien abductions or Bigfoot or something.", "par_id": 1029, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "There’s a famous psychology experiment [1] in which participants were told to wait in a room, and their reactions were recorded as the room gradually filled with smoke. In some cases, participants waited alone, while in other cases they waited with a group of people who, unbeknownst to the participant, were actors who had been instructed to ignore the smoke. Of the participants who waited alone, 75% reported the smoke. However, of the participants who waited with the group, only 10% reported the smoke.", "par_id": 1030, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "So, what could those participants have been thinking? Maybe something like: Hmm, why’s the room filling up with smoke? Is this a problem? *looks around the room* Well nobody else seems to care, so I guess not.", "par_id": 1031, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Looking back at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, I think maybe this is why so many of us didn’t think twice about the location of the initial outbreak. Hmm, is it kinda suspicious that this virus broke out near a major virology institute that works on bat coronaviruses? Should we maybe look into that? *looks around* Well nobody else seems to think so, so I guess not.", "par_id": 1032, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "I can’t speak for everyone else, but this was at least my mindset. I had vaguely heard something about how there was a virology research institute close to where the pandemic broke out, and that some conspiracy theorists were claiming it was the source of the virus. I looked around and noticed that nobody was really taking this idea seriously, so I figured I didn’t need to take it seriously either.", "par_id": 1033, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Also, I was thinking something like: Eh, probably every major city has labs and research institutes doing this kind of research. And I’ll bet they purposely built the virology institute close to where these viruses occur in nature, to give them easy access for sampling.", "par_id": 1034, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The type of research conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) is pretty rare and specialized. It includes things like creation of chimeric coronaviruses [1, 2], infecting humanized mice with bat coronaviruses, and other types of gain of function research, which Chan and Ridley devote a chapter to.", "par_id": 1035, "url_id": 21}

{"par": "So it does seem like a pretty remarkable coincidence that the outbreak happened in Wuhan. But maybe they purposely built the Wuhan Institute of Virology close to where these viruses are found in nature? Well, this also turns out to be wrong. The areas where viruses most similar to SARS-CoV-2 are found in nature are Yunnan province and Laos, which are more than a thousand kilometers away from Wuhan. The authors put this distance in perspective by noting that it’s more than the distance between Orlando and NYC.", "par_id": 1037, "url_id": 21}

{"par": "Although I enjoyed the book, I do have one pretty major criticism. The authors repeatedly make the claim that a virus called RaTG13, which was being studied at the WIV before the pandemic, is the closest known genetic match to SARS-CoV-2. But this claim is outdated and no longer correct. In September 2021 researchers identified a virus called BANAL-52 in Laos that’s a 96.8% match to SARS-CoV-2, closer than RaTG13’s 96.2% match. (Important note: a 96.8% match is still a long way off in genomic space, and does not imply that this is the same virus as SARS-CoV-2, or even necessarily a progenitor.)", "par_id": 1040, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "At first I thought maybe the authors didn’t mention BANAL-52 because it was discovered after the book was published, but this isn’t the case – Viral was published November 16, 2021, nearly two months after the discovery of BANAL-52 was published. Although I’m writing an overall-positive review here, I don’t want to go easy on the book where serious criticism is warranted. It’s completely unacceptable that BANAL-52 wasn’t mentioned. Even if it would have been inconvenient from a publishing standpoint, the authors should have rewritten the RaTG13 chapter, or at least included an addendum about the discovery of BANAL-52.", "par_id": 1041, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "With that being said, I think the story of RaTG13 is still interesting and important, so I’ll give a quick summary here.", "par_id": 1042, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "At the start of the pandemic in 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was quickly sequenced, and the full genome sequence was published by Dr. Shi Zhengli’s team at the WIV. In this paper, they also briefly mentioned that the genome was a 96.2% match with another bat coronavirus called RaTG13 – the closest known match at the time. Oddly, the mention of RaTG13 did not include any reference, footnote, or link to any previously published sequence.", "par_id": 1043, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Although the WIV didn’t provide details on this mysterious RaTG13 virus, a group of internet volunteers, including both amateurs as well as professional scientists working in their free time, began to investigate. This loose collection of open-source researchers, called DRASTIC, uncovered a medical thesis describing an outbreak of a mysterious disease in 2012. Six men who had been working in a bat-infested mine in Mojiang County, China, fell ill and were admitted to a hospital with symptoms including dry coughs, shortness of breath, fevers, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. Three of the men eventually died of this mysterious illness.", "par_id": 1044, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "In the years following this incident, teams of researchers (including a team led by Dr. Shi Zhengli of the WIV) were sent to investigate the cause of this illness and collect samples from the Mojiang mine. This sampling led to the discovery of a novel SARS-like coronavirus in 2013, and a part of its genomic sequence was published under the name BtCoV/4991 in 2016.", "par_id": 1045, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The DRASTIC researchers discovered that RaTG13 was genetically identical to the BtCoV/4991 sequence from the Mojiang mine – it was the same virus, and had just been renamed for some reason, without any public record of the change. They also discovered that at least eight other closely related coronaviruses were also sampled from this mine and brought to the WIV.", "par_id": 1046, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Although unhelpful throughout the investigation, the WIV eventually verified these facts when pressed on them, and an addendum was added to the original paper confirming DRASTIC’s account of the origin of RaTG13. ", "par_id": 1047, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "So what should we make of this? Well, as I mentioned before, RaTG13 is no longer the closest known genetic match to SARS-CoV-2, so maybe the whole story is less important as it pertains to the origin of the pandemic. But the discovery of BANAL-52 doesn’t really resolve things either [2]. Laos is very far away from Wuhan (actually even further than Yunnan), so we’re left with the same question as before – how did SARS-CoV-2 make it all the way to Wuhan from such a distant natural reservoir without leaving a trail along the way?", "par_id": 1048, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "A lot of the book is devoted to criticizing the Chinese government’s lack of transparency during the pandemic. Some brief examples:", "par_id": 1049, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "In the early days of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, hundreds of people were investigated and punished for the crime of “spreading rumors”. This included whistleblowing doctors who attempted to warn others [3] about the spread of the disease and its human-to-human transmission, which was being denied by the Chinese government at the time.", "par_id": 1050, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Access to the Mojiang mine (the source of the RaTG13 virus discussed in the previous section) was blocked off, and journalists attempting to visit it were harassed and detained by police.", "par_id": 1051, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "According to Chinese government directives, all academic research papers written by Chinese scientists are now required to go through a process of government review before being submitted for journal publication.", "par_id": 1052, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The WHO conducted an investigation that was apparently a sham. The investigation was composed of supervised, tightly-controlled visits to various sites in Wuhan, including a museum dedicated to China’s “heroic efforts to defeat the pandemic” – but the team was denied access to raw data from the early stages of the pandemic. At the end, they confidently concluded that a lab origin of SARS-CoV-2 was “extremely unlikely”, despite not having done any serious investigation into it. [4]", "par_id": 1053, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Virus sample sequences from early COVID patients in China were originally uploaded to an online database, but later removed in an apparent attempt at obfuscation. However, evolutionary biologist Jesse Bloom came up with a clever way to recover this data.", "par_id": 1054, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Probably the most important – the WIV had previously maintained a database of at least fifteen thousand bat samples, including the dates and locations of samples as well as information about the viruses found in them. This database was taken offline and its contents have not been shared with independent researchers since.", "par_id": 1055, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "At this point, we need to be cautious and police our emotions so that we don’t start favoring the lab leak hypothesis for non-scientific reasons. When reading about this stuff, it’s easy to get angry and start wanting the Chinese government to be guilty of something, but we need to consider all possible explanations. ", "par_id": 1056, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "It’s possible that the Chinese government was trying to cover up a lab leak, but it’s also possible that this was just regular authoritarian government behavior. Interestingly, Chan and Ridley describe similar attempts at obfuscation during the original SARS epidemic in 2003 (which had a natural origin), in which the Chinese government hid infected patients so that they wouldn’t be discovered by international health authorities. So I don’t think these attempts at obfuscation should necessarily be taken as evidence for a lab origin.", "par_id": 1057, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The book also criticizes a US-based research organization called the EcoHealth Alliance, and its president Peter Daszak. [5] The basic claim here, which I think has some merit, is that there was an attempt to artificially construct a scientific consensus from the top down, early on in the pandemic, even though such a consensus wasn’t (and isn’t) warranted by the evidence. This artificial scientific consensus was then picked up by tech companies, who used it to label discussion of the lab leak hypothesis as “misinformation”, as well as by media sources and fact checkers. I don’t want to get bogged down in all the convoluted details here, so I refer you to the book if you want to learn about it. It’s worth noting though that some of the scientists who publicly labeled the lab leak hypothesis as a “conspiracy theory” apparently considered it to be plausible in their private communications, which were obtained through FOIA requests. ", "par_id": 1058, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Whatever we think of the whole Daszak / EcoHealth Alliance story, it’s pretty clear that at the start of the pandemic many respected institutions – scientific journals, tech companies, media networks, the WHO – expressed a level of confidence in the natural origins hypothesis that was not warranted by the evidence. How should we update our opinions based on this overconfidence? Does it tell us anything about the origins of the virus?", "par_id": 1059, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Let’s say that your friend claims he can magically predict the result of a fair coin flip (only once). “There’s a 100% chance it’ll come up heads,” he says. If you’re gullible, you’ll update your belief in favor of heads. If you’re feeling annoyed at your friend, you might update in favor of tails out of spite [6]. Both of these would be wrong. The correct answer would be to not update at all on the object-level question of the coin flip (still 50-50), and to update negatively on the separate question of how trustworthy your friend’s predictions are. And remember, even if the coin does come up heads, you should still update negatively on your friend’s trustworthiness – he was still overconfident even though he happened to get it right by chance.", "par_id": 1060, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "This is basically how I think we should handle this unwarranted overconfidence from respected institutions – it should decrease our trust in these institutions, but we need to be careful not to start favoring the lab leak hypothesis out of spite. In my opinion this loss of trust should not really affect our view of the object-level question of the virus’s origin at all (although it would be nice to see some of the data being hidden, like that WIV database that was taken offline).", "par_id": 1061, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The book covers a lot of technical evidence that’s considered by some to point toward a lab origin. Although I’m a computational biologist myself, I don’t have the background knowledge required to evaluate this evidence, and have only been able to observe the back-and-forth debates between people who actually do have this background knowledge. So I didn’t update my opinion much based on these pieces of evidence, but I’ll still describe some of them here.", "par_id": 1062, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The first widely-cited piece of technical evidence has to do with the lack of rapid evolution of the virus early on in the pandemic. Some scientists claim that SARS-CoV-2 reached genetic stability early on, suggesting that it was already well-adapted to spread in humans at the start of the outbreak. Some have interpreted this as evidence that it was engineered for this purpose, or underwent serial passaging to encourage adaptation to human or humanized cells. Here’s a pre-print from May 2020 (on which Alina Chan is actually a co-author) making the claim that SARS-CoV-2 was already well-adapted to humans at the beginning of the pandemic. However, a review paper from proponents of the natural origins hypothesis disputes this claim, and offers several technical counterpoints, citing adaptive mutations later on in the pandemic that increased the virus’s fitness. ", "par_id": 1063, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "The second widely-cited piece of technical evidence is related to a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 called the furin cleavage site (FCS). The FCS increases the ability of the virus to infect certain types of cells, and is part of what makes SARS-CoV-2 especially contagious. It’s considered an unusual feature, and has not been found in the other viruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. It’s worth noting that previous gain of function research has included inserting a furin cleavage site into the original SARS virus from the 2003 epidemic. The debate over the FCS in SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related to sequence analysis, and I don’t have enough background knowledge on this to take a side on it either way. This is a paper by Rossana Segreto and Yuri Deigin claiming that the FCS may suggest genetic manipulation and point to a lab origin. For technical counterpoints on the FCS, I’ll refer you to the same review paper from natural origins proponents that I mentioned in the last paragraph. ", "par_id": 1064, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "A large chunk of the book is devoted to exploring these technical claims. These sections of the book are interesting and informative for hearing one perspective, but I definitely recommend checking out other sources with the technical counterpoints to get a full view of things. Personally I did not update my opinion based on these pieces of evidence because I don’t have enough background knowledge to evaluate opposing claims being made about them. ", "par_id": 1065, "url_id": 21}
{"par": "Also, I think it’s worth noting that the debates around these pieces of evidence are specifically related to the subset of lab leak possibilities that involves genetic engineering and manipulation. However, even if it were proven, beyond a doubt, that SARS-CoV-2 was not the product of genetic engineering, that would not rule out the possibility that it was a natural virus, collected from the field, that was stored in the WIV and leaked out. I want to point this out because I’ve seen some semantic confusion where people claim to “disprove” the lab leak hypothesis, when really they are given arguments specifically against the possibility of genetic engineering.", "par_id": 1066, "url_id": 21}

{"par": "Some of these bits are either false, misleading, or meaningless. For example, Chan and Ridley tell the story of Dr. Limeng Yan, a scientist-turned-whistleblower who fled to the US in April 2020 in fear of being “disappeared” in China. By all accounts, Dr. Yan started off as a legitimate whistleblower. She learned of COVID’s human-to-human transmission early on, when it was still being denied by the Chinese government, tried to report it up her chain of command (but was told to keep quiet), and ended up leaking the information to a Youtube commentator who told the world – and of course, it was confirmed by the Chinese government and WHO the next day. But instead of the story ending there, with Dr. Yan as a brave hero, things took a sad turn. She fled to the US in fear, but ended up in a situation where her only American contacts were people with their own political agendas (including Steve Bannon). Facing this scary and uncertain situation in a foreign land, it seems she basically told these people what they wanted to hear, and possibly ended up believing it herself through self-deception. Soon she was giving interviews to right-wing media outlets, spouting the actual unfounded conspiracy theory that SARS-CoV-2 was a bioweapon released by China on purpose, and other false information.", "par_id": 1068, "url_id": 21}

{"par": "It’s easy to dismiss the ridiculous claim that COVID began as a bioweapon, but other claims are more difficult to evaluate.

E.g., the CDC says that tobacco smoking kills 480,000 Americans per year (https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/features/excessive-alcohol-deaths.html). That’s way worse than most illegal drugs.

The drug laws guarantee that the drug industry will be controlled by criminal organizations, rather than law-abiding businesses.

They want to hear that our problems have simple, cost-free or nearly cost-free solutions – that, e.g., you can solve poverty by just passing a new law which won’t cost them (the voters) anything.

{"par": "If sense data exist, where exactly are they located? I think there is no satisfying answer to this.", "par_id": 1520, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "You could try saying that they are located in the same place as the physical object that causes them. But that’s odd; why don’t they get in the way of the physical object? If you look up in the night sky and see a star 1000 light years away, does your experience cause a sense datum to appear 1000 light years away, on the surface of that star? This violates special relativity since it requires superluminal influence.", "par_id": 1521, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "You could say sense data are wherever they appear to be (just as they have all other characteristics they appear to have). Maybe the star that’s 1000 light years away doesn’t really appear to be 1000 light years away; perhaps it only appears a few hundred feet away, thus avoiding the superluminal influence problem. But then you’d run into problems with sense data that don’t appear to be in any particular actual location. E.g., say you have a hallucination of being in an alternative world – you hallucinate a complete scene in Middle Earth, which doesn’t actually exist. The sense data cannot literally be in Middle Earth, since there is no such place.", "par_id": 1522, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "You could say they appear in your head, in your brain. But it just sounds super naïve to suggest that when you see a tomato, a tiny tomato-shaped thing appears inside your head. We might wonder why these things don’t get in the way of your brain material. Since sense data have the characteristics they appear to have, if you feel an object that feels solid, that means a solid object appears inside your brain. Wouldn’t that damage your brain?", "par_id": 1523, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "You could say they appear in a separate space, “phenomenal space”, with no spatial relations to physical space. This also violates relativity, if you care about that (nothing can be in physical time without being in physical space, because space and time do not exist as separate things, according to relativity). It’s also a pretty extravagant and bizarre posit. Do we really have to postulate a whole nother space, just to explain our seeing normal physical objects? It would be pretty hard to explain how things in physical space can interact causally with things in this alternate space.", "par_id": 1524, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "Lastly, you could try saying that sense data have no locations. But in perception, we seem to see things with locations. They also seem to have other spatial properties, like sizes and shapes, and nothing can have spatial properties without being in space. Nor can anything be in space without being in any particular location.", "par_id": 1525, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "So there seems to be no good answer to where sense data are.", "par_id": 1526, "url_id": 27}

{"par": "The problem is that objects can have indeterminate appearances. By this, I mean that an object can appear to fall on some dimension, in some range, but fail to appear to have any specific, exact value within that range. E.g., perhaps an object might appear red but not appear any exact shade of red. Or an object could appear to have a shape, but not appear to have any specific, perfectly precise shape.", "par_id": 1528, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "Examples: when you look at different shades of colors, there is a limit to how many shades you can distinguish. If a small enough difference is made in an object’s spectral reflectance, you fail to notice the difference. This means that you can’t tell whether the two colors are the same or slightly different. The inability to tell if they are the same has to be explained by saying that you don’t perceive a perfectly precise color. This is also needed to explain why you can have a series of pairwise indistinguishable shades where the first is definitely distinguishable from the last.", "par_id": 1529, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "Another example: You look at a sign from a distance. You can tell that it has writing on it, but you cannot read it. Now, what exact shape does the writing on the sign appear to you to have? There’s no answer to that; if there were such an exact shape, then you should be able to read the sign (if the shape corresponds to that of some sequence of words in your language); alternately, if the apparent shape is one that doesn’t match any sequence of words in your language, then you should (a) have the experience of seeing that the sign is written in some alien language, and (b) find, as you move closer to the sign, that the letters appear to change their shapes. You’d then conclude that you were hallucinating when looking at the sign from a distance.", "par_id": 1530, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "Of course none of that happens. You can’t read the sign, nor does it appear to have some alien language, nor does it appear that the shapes change as you move closer, nor are you hallucinating. The only way to explain this is to say that, when you view the sign from a distance, the apparent shapes of the words are indeterminate. That is, your experience fails to represent the exact shapes.", "par_id": 1531, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "There are two accounts of perceptual appearance. One is the intentionality theory: When something perceptually appears F to you, that’s a matter of your having a mental state that represents that the object is F. The other theory is the sense data theory: When something perceptually appears F to you, that is a matter of your being directly aware of a mental object that is F.", "par_id": 1532, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "The first theory accommodates indeterminate appearances, because indeterminacy in representations is perfectly possible. Compare the fact that one can easily believe that an object is colored without believing, for any particular color, that the object is that specific color. It’s perfectly possible for an object to be represented as (F or G) without being represented as F and without being represented as G.", "par_id": 1533, "url_id": 27}
{"par": "But the sense data theory does not accommodate indeterminate appearances. That’s because it’s impossible for an object to actually have indeterminate properties.

{"par": "My guess is that most people who complain of unfair prices, especially unfair wages, don’t have any clear idea of what the criterion of fairness is.

You can tell that, for one thing, because you can figure out the rates of change if given the current configuration, but not vice versa.

Even the most utilitarian people we have are still people who, in terms of actual motivation to act, value their own welfare hundreds or thousands of times more than the welfare of strangers.

Most fundamentally, in this context, diversity would be variety of ideas, experiences, and attitudes, especially those relevant to the things that people are learning about in school.

It seems that you have no evidence against the BIV hypothesis, since all your evidence about the external world consists of your sensory experiences, and the BIV would have the same sensory experiences.

{"par": "Normal people assume that, based on our past observations of emeralds, we should infer that all emeralds are green, and not that all emeralds are grue. Goodman introduced the concept “grue” to make the point that, when you observe many A’s that are F, you don’t necessarily have evidence for “All A’s are F”; no matter how many grue emeralds you observe before 2100, you have no evidence that all emeralds are grue.", "par_id": 1916, "url_id": 39}
{"par": "Goodman was not trying to make a skeptical point. Nevertheless, you could imagine a skeptic showing up and seizing the opportunity.

For any inductive conclusion you like, you could introduce a grue-like predicate, then formulate a hypothesis that exactly fits all our evidence but predicts what we would intuitively describe as very different things happening in the future from what has happened in the past. The skeptic can then argue that we have no reason to reject this alternative hypothesis, so we have no reason to accept the normal inductive conclusion.

{"par": "For a simpler argument: Just start out by stipulating that E is a proposition describing all the evidence you have. If E doesn’t entail h, then there exists an h’ that entails both E and ~h. By Premise 1, you need a reason to reject h’. By Premise 2, E doesn’t furnish any such reason. Since E includes all your evidence, you have no evidence that provides a reason to reject h’. So you have no reason to reject h’. So you’re not justified in believing h.", "par_id": 1931, "url_id": 39}
{"par": "First, you might think that we moved too fast in claiming that, when e fails to entail h, there is always an alternative theory, h’, that entails both e and ~h. The easiest way to “establish” that claim is to let h’ = (e & ~h). But you might think “e & ~h” is a pretty bogus example of a “theory”, perhaps because “e & ~h” doesn’t genuinely explain why e is the case, as h typically does explain why e is the case. (Ex.: The Theory of Gravity explains why we see things fall to the ground, but “things fall to the ground and the Theory of Gravity is false” does not explain why things fall to the ground.)", "par_id": 1932, "url_id": 39}
{"par": "And perhaps Premise 1 only applies to competing explanations of the evidence. I.e., if h and h’ are competing explanations of the evidence, then you need an independent reason to reject h’ before you accept h. But if h’ isn’t an explanation of the evidence at all, perhaps you don’t need this; perhaps you can reject h’ on the basis of h itself. So I could say that my reason for rejecting (e & ~h) is that the second conjunct of it is false, and my reason for thinking so is that h.", "par_id": 1933, "url_id": 39}
{"par": "In response, the skeptic can generally think of better examples of h’ than just “e & ~h”. E.g., the brain-in-a-vat scenario really does seem like a candidate explanation of our evidence.

Likewise, if you think that “all emeralds are green” explains our seeing many green emeralds in the past, then it’s unclear why “all emeralds are grue” wouldn’t also be a candidate explanation of that.

{"par": "The third solution I can think of would start by modifying Premise 2. Again, Premise 2 said that if H entails E, then E can’t be a reason to reject H.

{"par": "Why add this qualifier? Recall two quirks about entailment that you learned in intro logic: first, that if x is contradictory, then x automatically entails y, no matter what y is; second, if y is a necessary truth, then x automatically entails y, no matter what x is.

{"par": "These two quirks mean that Premise 2 (as originally formulated) is false. Example: (P & ~P) entails P.

{"par": "So say we accept the qualification: Premise 2 only holds when the evidence & hypothesis are contingent. Now the solution to the problem of defeasible justification would claim that, when e defeasibly justifies h, we always have some necessary truths that provide reasons for rejecting h’. What might these necessary truths be? Well, for example, the proposition [h is simpler than h’] will, if true, be a necessary truth, and we might think it’s a reason to prefer h over h’.

They also do not try to prevent the deadly disease outbreak in 1996 because they know that any such attempt would fail, since they know that the outbreak did in fact happen. That’s an example of one of the less-irritating time travel stories, since it doesn’t go out of its way to contradict itself as other movies do.

If we think slavery is unjust, but it’s really just, then exactly the same things will happen as will happen if we think slavery is unjust and we’re right. The actual justice or injustice makes no empirical difference. In the Hitler example, the true explanation is the psychological fact that Hitler had intense, racial hatred. The idea that such a motivation constitutes evil adds no extra explanatory power. If Hitler had such hatred but this didn’t constitute evil, then exactly the same stuff would happen as if it was evil.", "par_id": 1994, "url_id": 41}
{"par": "Naturalist response: Two points. First, it’s long been accepted in philosophy of science that a scientific theory doesn’t predict any observations by itself; rather, you usually have to use a whole complex of auxiliary assumptions, including other, background theoretical beliefs, to derive observational predictions from a theory. Thus, it should be okay to do this with moral theories too. Now, given our background beliefs, the theory that Hitler is evil predicts that he would be more likely to do stuff like ordering the Holocaust. It’s not an objection to this to point out that this relies on background beliefs about evilness.", "par_id": 1995, "url_id": 41}
{"par": "Second, one of the keys to “good explanation” is unification. Ex.: if you want to explain why a certain peg won’t fit into a certain hole, the best explanation might be “you can’t put a square peg into a round hole” (with a diameter smaller than the diagonal of the square). The best explanation isn’t to cite the specific configuration of all the elementary particles in the peg, etc. The reason the “square peg/round hole” explanation is better than the microphysical one is that the “square peg/round hole” explanation lets you know what to expect the next time you try to put another square peg (with a different configuration of particles) into another round hole. It unifies cases that intuitively belong together, which the microphysical explanation doesn’t.", "par_id": 1996, "url_id": 41}
{"par": "Moral explanations might be like this too. Each case of evilness has some underlying, psychological characteristics that constitute the evil (but different psychological configurations in different cases).

Someone with an alternative value system could posit that extreme racial hatred constitutes good, and this person could then explain exactly the same events, equally naturally. To the extent that the “evil” theory unifies observations (per sec. 3 above), the same unification could be achieved by the “good” theory.", "par_id": 2005, "url_id": 41}

(157-8) There are no cases in the Constitution where the word “person” is used where it appears to include fetuses. Also, laws were pretty permissive about abortion in the 19th century, so people at the time the 14A was adopted would probably not have considered fetuses to fall under the term “person”.

Presumably, the 9A was not intended to be completely without effect. In order for it to have any effect, courts must sometimes enforce unenumerated rights. The only way to do that would be to use their own moral judgments about what rights we have (or perhaps what rights would have been recognized at the time of the founding?).

Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it.

Also, note that the court was here protecting a general right to an abortion, not just for cases where the mother’s health is particularly threatened.

{"par": "Some philosophers reject the closure principle. Note: The issue is not whether, if P is true and P entails Q, then Q must be true. Obviously, truth satisfies closure – that’s trivial.

If the above is how we defend the Closure Principle, then in order to defend the second premise of the skeptic’s argument, the skeptic is going to have to beg the question. The second premise claims that we lack justification for thinking that we’re not BIV’s. But why think that? Why can’t I just look down at my body, see that I have arms and legs, which a mere BIV doesn’t have, and deduce that I’m not a BIV?", "par_id": 2167, "url_id": 46}

So the only thing the skeptic could say at this point is that I can’t justify the belief that I'm not a BIV in this way because I'm not justified in thinking I have two hands. But that italicized claim is just (an instance of) the skeptic’s conclusion. So they’d have to appeal to their conclusion to justify their second premise. So the skeptic’s argument essentially begs the question.", "par_id": 2168, "url_id": 46}

{"par": "Here’s an analogy. Let’s say we have some weird phenomena in quantum mechanics, and there are two interpretations of the evidence: the Copenhagen Interpretation (which has some crazy stuff about observers creating reality, reality being indeterminate, etc.) and Bohm’s Interpretation (which is completely sensible). Suppose physicist A asserts the Copenhagen Interp based on the quantum mechanical phenomena that have been observed. Physicist B says, “Not so fast. All that evidence could instead by explained by Bohm’s Interp. If you’re going to accept the Copenhagen theory, you have to explain what's wrong with Bohm’s theory.”", "par_id": 2170, "url_id": 46}
{"par": "Sounds reasonable. But imagine that Physicist A has been reading Dretske, so he knows that justification isn’t closed under entailment. So he replies: “You’re right, I can’t rule out Bohm’s theory. But that doesn’t matter because justification isn’t closed under entailment. For all I know, Bohm is right; nevertheless, I still know that the Copenhagen Interpretation is right.”", "par_id": 2171, "url_id": 46}
{"par": "Or suppose that A has been reading Klein, so he knows that if the closure principle is correct, it’s because when P is justified, you can use it to justify anything that P entails. So he announces: “Okay, maybe I have to be able to rule out Bohm’s theory. But if that’s true, then I can rule it out straightforwardly: the Copenhagen theory is correct; therefore, Bohm is wrong. And if you reject this argument, you’re begging the question.”", "par_id": 2172, "url_id": 46}
{"par": "Intuitively, neither of these replies should work. The Bohmian “skeptic” cannot be dismissed so easily.

{"par": "So I’m debating Peter Singer, a philosopher who’s already convinced me to give piles of money to charity. How did he convince me? With his famous Drowning Child thought experiment.  He’s probably going to tell you the long version himself, so I’ll just give a quick recap.  You’re walking along in your best clothes, and see a child drowning in a pool.  You’re the only person in sight, and the only way for you to save him is to wade in and ruin your best clothes.  Should you still save the child?", "par_id": 2282, "url_id": 50}

{"par": "As I’m confident Singer will agree, the point of his thought experiment is that almost everyone in countries like the United States consumes far more than they actually need.  If ordinary First Worlders cut back, we could save the lives of many absolutely poor people, almost all of whom live in poor countries like Haiti, Bangladesh, and Congo.  While it’s demagogically convenient to single out billionaires because 99.99% of their consumption is unnecessary, Singer’s thought experiment is almost as damning of middle-class Americans. After all, 90% of their consumption is unnecessary, too. ", "par_id": 2284, "url_id": 50}

{"par": "But what if you just don’t care about foreigners?  What if, Singer notwithstanding, your moral priority is blaming rich people in the First World for failing to help poorer fellow citizens?  Even then, my variant on Singer’s hypothetical is highly relevant.  Because besides causing massive foreign poverty with immigration restrictions, the demagogues who rule us also cause massive domestic poverty with housing regulation.  (Many other bad policies, too, but the evil of housing regulation is unusually clear-cut).  As I explain in my forthcoming Build, Baby, Build: The Science and Ethics of Housing Regulation, the construction industry in the U.S. and almost all other countries lives under draconian rules.  Government makes it very hard to build tall buildings, multi-family buildings, and dense buildings.  Overall, they practically treat the businesses that house us like criminals. ", "par_id": 2297, "url_id": 50}

{"par": "“Do the rich pay their fair share?”  Most debaters in my position would have focused on the fact that the rich pay a greatly disproportionate share of taxes.  Indeed they do: In the U.S., the top quintile of earners pay 68% of all federal taxes.  But it’s the larger context that makes moral denunciation of the rich so outrageous.  Governments directly hinder people’s efforts to solve their own poverty problems.  Not just a little.  A lot.  Then they point their demagogic fingers at the rich for selfishly keeping money they don’t need. ", "par_id": 2299, "url_id": 50}
{"par": "What, then, is my punchline?  This: The rich are “guilty” of the same thing as virtually all of us, so please stop singling them for moral condemnation.  Focus instead on your own philanthropy.  If you’re going to morally condemn anyone, condemn the wide range of political leaders who callously cause severe poverty globally and domestically to make themselves popular.  Most rich people aren’t exactly heroes, but even the politicians you most admire are probably bona fide villains.", "par_id": 2300, "url_id": 50}

{"par": "Hearing this thoughtful question put a big smile on my face.  I was so proud of my progeny.  And an answer was already in my head.  “Sons,” I began,  “in life, there are many things that sound good but are bad – and many things that sound bad but are good.  Suppose someone says, ‘The government should just give everybody whatever they need.’  How does that sound?”", "par_id": 2664, "url_id": 73}

{"par": "Sicily’s population has been flat for the last 30 years. The countryside often looks utterly empty. After one wrong turn, we lost sight of not only other cars, but any sign of human habitation for miles around. Italy’s foreign-born population share is just 11%, below the U.S., France, Germany, the U.K., and Spain. ", "par_id": 2672, "url_id": 74}
{"par": "Even so, popular opposition to immigration is strong. Lega Nord, the party that used to push for northern secession from the parasitic south, has rebranded itself as Lega, an anti-immigration party for all Italians. It’s now the biggest party in the Italian Chamber of Deputies - and according to my contacts, becoming big in Sicily despite its history of disdain for the south.", "par_id": 2673, "url_id": 74}
{"par": "Compared to the U.S., U.K., Germany, Spain, or even France, immigrants seemed poorly integrated into the Italian labor force. Most strikingly, I saw large groups of apparently unemployed young African males hanging out in some of the piazzas of Modena, Parma, and Florence. The most common job for employed Africans was street vending, mostly of products that tourists would only buy out of pity. My assumption was that neither type of migrant was legally able to work, but none of my contacts had much intel on their plight. The African migrants didn’t seem to be homeless, because they disappeared at night and rarely begged. Were they living in refugee centers? Packed into shared apartments? ", "par_id": 2674, "url_id": 74}
{"par": "The unemployed young African males in the piazzas almost surely reinforced Italians’ negative attitudes about migration. Intellectually, this makes little sense: If the Italian government bans migrants from working, it’s silly to blame migrants for being “lazy.” Similarly, if the Italian government keeps migrants on welfare indefinitely, it’s hardly surprising if they’re slow to learn Italian and land a low-skill job. And given Italy’s draconian labor regulation, it’s probably quite hard for migrants to secure legal positions. Emotionally, though, highly visible idle migrants almost surely help Italian nativist parties like Lega win votes.", "par_id": 2675, "url_id": 74}
{"par": "In Sicily, my contacts told me that mostly-illegal migrant workers have become the backbone of not only Sicilian agriculture, but Sicilian fishing. The migration charity workers that I encountered insisted that migrant farm workers were legal to work in any job, but were somehow “roped-in” to horrifying exploitation. I believe the former, not the latter, but saw nothing probative with my own eyes.", "par_id": 2676, "url_id": 74}
{"par": "I often told my students that U.S. restriction of immigration in the 1920s was heavily motivated by anti-Italian prejudice.

{"par": "“The U.S. excluded southern and eastern Europeans because they believed they were inferior. But the subsequent performance of these groups in the U.S. has been average or even above average.” I made this point several times in my class, but how telling is it really? On reflection, quite telling, because the best predictor of future performance is past performance - and that naturally holds for the reliability of judgment. If most native-born Americans a hundred years ago assumed that southern and eastern Europeans - even Jews! - would become a permanent underclass, their judgment must have been very poor. And there’s little reason to deem the judgment of modern native-born Americans on such questions any better.", "par_id": 2678, "url_id": 74}
{"par": "My students were aware that Italian-Americans were a major demographic, especially on America’s east coast. Their current population is around 18 million, a little less than one-third of the total population of Italy. But the cultural distance is striking.

{"par": "Both Americans and Italians sense that the south has been losing population to the north. How extreme is the effect? Let’s compare Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto in the far north to Sicily, Calabria, Apulia, and Campania in the far south. From 1991-2021,  Lombardy’s population grew 12%, Piedmont’s -1%, Emilia-Romagna’s 13%, and Veneto’s 11%. During the same time, Sicily grew -3%, Calabria -9%, Apulia -3%, and Campania 1%.  So we’re talking about roughly .5 percentage-points of divergence per year. Not earth-shattering, but this is despite heavy tax incentives for foreigners to live in the south. Only 30% of foreigners’ income is taxable in most of Italy, but the share drops to just 10% in the south.", "par_id": 2680, "url_id": 74}

My knee-jerk guess is that the U.S. could siphon off 5% of the population of Italy with 20 years of open borders, though due to diaspora dynamics, that’s probably an understatement.

Long story short: After listening to economically illiterate migration charity workers, I went to Google Scholar to get a better picture.

{"par": "Living in Italy, it’s clear that the U.S., Italians, and humanity suffered a great loss when the U.S. all but banned Italian immigration in the 1920s. Italian-Americans have a much higher standard of living - and contribute much more to the world - than Italians in Italy. Immigration from Italy is a clear-cut immigration success story. The benefits of immigration to Italy, in contrast, seem like they’ve been atypically suppressed by the Italian government’s stubborn commitment to redistribution and labor regulation.
