{"sent": "In Schaffner’s account, as technology moved on into the industrial era, we start to see new ideas from science being put into service to explain exhaustion, and many of these theories concerned the expenditure or transfer of finite amounts of energy and a subsequent rest state or energy deficit: that is, we begin to use things up and can’t replenish them.", "sent_id": 2029, "url_id": 24}

{"sent": "However, a review paper from proponents of the natural origins hypothesis disputes this claim, and offers several technical counterpoints, citing adaptive mutations later on in the pandemic that increased the virus’s fitness.", "sent_id": 2370, "url_id": 28}
{"sent": "The second widely-cited piece of technical evidence is related to a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 called the furin cleavage site (FCS).", "sent_id": 2371, "url_id": 28}
{"sent": "The FCS increases the ability of the virus to infect certain types of cells, and is part of what makes SARS-CoV-2 especially contagious.", "sent_id": 2372, "url_id": 28}
{"sent": "It’s considered an unusual feature, and has not been found in the other viruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2.", "sent_id": 2373, "url_id": 28}

{"sent": "Also, I think it’s worth noting that the debates around these pieces of evidence are specifically related to the subset of lab leak possibilities that involves genetic engineering and manipulation.", "sent_id": 2380, "url_id": 28}
{"sent": "However, even if it were proven, beyond a doubt, that SARS-CoV-2 was not the product of genetic engineering, that would not rule out the possibility that it was a natural virus, collected from the field, that was stored in the WIV and leaked out.", "sent_id": 2381, "url_id": 28}
{"sent": "I want to point this out because I’ve seen some semantic confusion where people claim to “disprove” the lab leak hypothesis, when really they are given arguments specifically against the possibility of genetic engineering.", "sent_id": 2382, "url_id": 28}

{"sent": "She learned of COVID’s human-to-human transmission early on, when it was still being denied by the Chinese government, tried to report it up her chain of command (but was told to keep quiet), and ended up leaking the information to a Youtube commentator who told the world – and of course, it was confirmed by the Chinese government and WHO the next day.", "sent_id": 2385, "url_id": 28}
{"sent": "She fled to the US in fear, but ended up in a situation where her only American contacts were people with their own political agendas (including Steve Bannon).", "sent_id": 2386, "url_id": 28}

{"sent": "For the benefits may stem from the mere possession of the disposition, rather than the downstream acts that it disposes you towards.", "sent_id": 5746, "url_id": 122}

{"sent": "This strikes me as a point at which Parfit may have failed to take sufficient account of his own lessons.", "sent_id": 5752, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "If you act on those motives and gratuitously harm someone, just because you want to see them suffer, we may reject Parfit’s suggestion that the optimality of possessing the motives renders their harmful exercise “blameless”.", "sent_id": 5753, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "We can agree that it’s a good thing that you have the malicious motives, but that doesn’t change the fact that they are malicious, or ill-willed, and hence in acting upon them you act viciously, which merits disapproval.", "sent_id": 5754, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "Perhaps others should refrain from expressing their disapproval, as we wouldn’t want you to lose your world-saving malicious motives.", "sent_id": 5755, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "But it’s worth bearing in mind that this remains compatible with judging the present agent to be “blameworthy” in the ordinary sense of being worthy of moral criticism or disapproval.", "sent_id": 5756, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "Just as the agent’s motives may be doubly-assessable, as simultaneously optimal and yet morally misguided, so too may our attitudes of approval or disapproval.", "sent_id": 5757, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "One might resist such judgments on the grounds that the agent’s prior sacrifice was so immensely praiseworthy that any overall assessment of the agent must be positive.", "sent_id": 5758, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "That latter claim seems right, but I am assuming here that we can offer a temporally “localized” criticism of the present agent, without thereby implying that they are eternally or overall bad.", "sent_id": 5759, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "The distinction between optimality and accuracy becomes even more stark when we consider that one can privately feel disapproval without in any way expressing this.", "sent_id": 5760, "url_id": 122}
{"sent": "For suppose that the evil demon will now start torturing people if anyone dares to—even privately—disapprove of malice.", "sent_id": 5761, "url_id": 122}

{"sent": "This latter view would have much the same practical implications as prioritarianism, but without the theoretical costs.", "sent_id": 5805, "url_id": 124}

{"sent": "That said, I suspect that much of the temptation to regard the smaller happiness boost to the sad person as constituting a greater benefit stems from illicitly building in further instrumental effects: perhaps that little burst of happiness is all Joe needs to get out of his funk that day, yielding longer-lasting good effects.", "sent_id": 5808, "url_id": 124}

{"sent": ")To that objection, the appropriate response seems to me to be something like this: (1) You've described a morally reckless agent, who was almost certainly not warranted in thinking that their particular performance of a typically-disastrous act would avoid being disastrous.", "sent_id": 5949, "url_id": 130}
{"sent": "(2) If we imagine that somehow the voice of God reassured the agent that no-one would ever find out, so no long-run harm would be done, then that changes matters.", "sent_id": 5950, "url_id": 130}

{"sent": "If someone insists that they not only endorse the utilitarian-compatible claims in this vicinity, but additionally judge that the act itself \"clearly\" ought not to be done (even in the \"100% reliable\" version of the case), then I'll grant that they find utilitarianism counterintuitive in this respect.", "sent_id": 5955, "url_id": 130}

{"sent": "This verdict can be further reinforced by thinking about what all the affected parties would have preferred from behind a veil of ignorance, or about what a benevolent observer/God would wish for you to do, or about how deontic constraints enshrine status quo bias, etc.", "sent_id": 5985, "url_id": 131}
{"sent": "So: Deontology may capture superficial verdicts, but it just falls apart completely when you dig a little deeper into the cases.", "sent_id": 5986, "url_id": 131}

{"sent": "That doesn't seem universally correct to me, and indeed it seems self-defeating for Huemer to appeal to this general principle when faced with a specific dialectic in which the conflict of intuitions intuitively favours utilitarianism.", "sent_id": 5990, "url_id": 131}

{"sent": "Given the divergence between the normative concepts central to consequentialism and the ordinary (vague and undefinable) sense of \"wrongness\", it's an interesting question whether consequentialism is best understood as offering an internal revision of how we should understand \"wrong\", etc., or as offering an external rival to morality.", "sent_id": 6000, "url_id": 131}

{"sent": "Most of the intuitions evoked by critics of utilitarianism arguably don't directly address this question of what we have most reason to do (or what we really ought — as opposed to merely \"morally\" ought, in some restricted or \"inverted-commas\" sense — to do).", "sent_id": 6003, "url_id": 131}
